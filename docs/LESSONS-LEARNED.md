# Lessons Learned: Building a Dynatrace Platform App with AI

A comprehensive record of patterns, pitfalls, and proven strategies from building the **Healthcare Health Monitoring** DT platform app (v1.0 → v1.4.8) using AI-assisted development. This document is intended to serve as the foundation for an **AI skill for DT app development**.

---

## 1. Project Setup & Toolchain

### What Worked
- **`dt-app` CLI** (`npx dt-app init`, `build`, `deploy`) is the standard toolchain. Version 1.8.1 is stable.
- `app.config.json` defines the app manifest: id, name, version, scopes, and environment URL.
- React 18 + TypeScript 5.9 is the standard stack. Strato design system components are imported from `@dynatrace/strato-components/*`.

### Key Lessons
| Lesson | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Version bumps are mandatory** | Deploying the same version with different code fails (checksum mismatch). Always increment `app.config.json` version before `npx dt-app deploy`. |
| **Deploy requires local browser** | `npx dt-app deploy` opens a browser for SSO authentication. It cannot work via SSH or headless. Use `rsync` to pull code locally, then deploy from a machine with a browser. |
| **`npx dt-app dev`** | Runs a local dev server with hot reload. Useful for iteration but requires the DT environment to be reachable. |

### Scopes
The app needs explicit scopes in `app.config.json` for every data type it reads:
```json
{ "name": "storage:logs:read" },
{ "name": "storage:buckets:read" },
{ "name": "storage:metrics:read" },
{ "name": "storage:bizevents:read" },
{ "name": "storage:events:read" },
{ "name": "davis:problems:read" }
```

## 2. Strato Components — What Works and What Doesn't

### Chart Imports
**Always** import charts from `@dynatrace/strato-components/charts`, NOT `@dynatrace/strato-components-preview/charts`. The preview package has different APIs and will break builds.

### Component-Specific Gotchas

| Component | Issue | Solution |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **TimeseriesChart** | Data gaps show as breaks in lines | Add `gapPolicy="connect"` prop |
| **HoneycombChart** | Doesn't accept object arrays | Pass `number[]` only (e.g., CPU values) |
| **Select / FilterBar** | `Select.Content` wrapper required around `Select.Option` children; FilterBar expects specific structures | Bypass entirely — use button-based toggle filters instead. Simpler, more reliable. |
| **DonutChart** | Needs `{ name, value }[]` format | Use a helper function `toDonutData(records)` |
| **CategoricalBarChart** | Needs `{ name, value }[]` format | Use a helper function `toBarData(records)` |

### TimeseriesChart Data Format
The `useDql` hook returns raw Grail records. For timeseries charts, use a `toTimeseries()` helper that converts `{ timeframe, interval, ... }` records into the format TimeseriesChart expects. This is NOT documented well — you need to inspect the component's TypeScript types.

### Layout Components
- `Flex`, `Surface`, `TitleBar` from `@dynatrace/strato-components/layouts`
- `Text` from `@dynatrace/strato-components/typography`
- `ProgressCircle` from `@dynatrace/strato-components/content`

## 3. DQL Queries — Critical Patterns

### Query Types and Their Behaviors

| Query Type | Starts With | Returns | Filter Method |
|------------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| Log queries | `fetch logs` | Records with named fields | `\| filter field == "value"` |
| Metric queries | `timeseries` | Timeseries arrays | `filter: {dimension == "value"}` parameter |
| Aggregated logs | `fetch logs ... \| makeTimeseries` | Timeseries from log counts | `\| filter` before `\| makeTimeseries` |

### Site Filtering Strategy

The `withSiteFilter(query, siteCode, kind)` function handles injection for all query types:

1. **Log queries**: Finds the first `| filter` line and appends a new filter line after it
2. **Timeseries queries**: Detects `timeseries ` or `timeseries\n` at the start and injects `filter: {site == "..."}` before the first keyword parameter (`by:`, `from:`, `interval:`)
3. **NetFlow queries**: Uses `network.device.site` instead of `healthcare.site`

**Critical discovery**: Multiline `timeseries` queries (where `timeseries` is followed by a newline, not a space) need explicit detection. A simple `startsWith("timeseries ")` misses them.

### Site Alias Backward Compatibility
When site codes change, maintain an alias map so historical data still matches:
```typescript
export const SITE_ALIAS: Record<string, string> = {
  "tpk-clinic": "oak-clinic",
  "wch-clinic": "wel-clinic",
  "lwr-clinic": "bel-clinic",
};
```
The filter function expands the selected site to include all its aliases in an OR clause.

### DQL Bucket Filters
- Epic and Network logs: `dt.system.bucket == "observe_and_troubleshoot_apps_95_days" AND healthcare.pipeline == "healthcare-epic"`
- NetFlow: `log.source == "netflow"` (bucket filter removed because netflow data may land in different buckets)

## 4. SVG Map with Canvas Animation Overlay

### Architecture
The campus map uses two overlapping layers:
1. **SVG layer**: Static map (Kansas outline, highways, cities, site icons, flow lines)
2. **Canvas layer**: Animated particles traveling along flow lines

### Geo Projection
An equirectangular projection maps real lat/lon to SVG coordinates:
```typescript
const KS_WEST = -102.05, KS_EAST = -94.59;
const KS_NORTH = 40.003, KS_SOUTH = 36.993;
function lonToX(lon) { return ((lon - KS_WEST) / (KS_EAST - KS_WEST)) * CW + PAD_X; }
function latToY(lat) { return ((KS_NORTH - lat) / (KS_NORTH - KS_SOUTH)) * CH + PAD_Y; }
```

### Critical Canvas/SVG Alignment Bug
**Problem**: SVG uses `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"` (uniform scaling + centering), but the canvas initially used independent x/y scaling. This causes particle dots to drift from SVG flow lines, especially on wider containers.

**Solution**: The canvas must compute the same uniform scale and offset:
```typescript
const uniformScale = Math.min(rect.width / VB_W, rect.height / VB_H);
const offsetX = (rect.width - VB_W * uniformScale) / 2;
const offsetY = (rect.height - VB_H * uniformScale) / 2;
// Then: x = gx * uniformScale + offsetX
```

### Geographic Accuracy Matters
- Kansas City, MO (39.0997, -94.5786) is east of `KS_EAST` — renders outside the Kansas boundary
- Kansas City, KS (Wyandotte County, 39.1155, -94.6268) renders at the very edge
- Lawrence, KS (38.9717, -95.2353) is well inside Kansas along I-70 — good hub location
- Always validate that site coordinates fall within the projection bounds

### Ensuring Hub Presence
If the DQL siteHealthSummary query doesn't return kcrmc-main (e.g., no recent data), the flow origin disappears. The map must always inject the hub into geoSites as a fallback:
```typescript
if (!mapped.find(s => s.code === "kcrmc-main") && SITE_GEO["kcrmc-main"]) {
  mapped.push({ code: "kcrmc-main", ...defaults, ...SITE_GEO["kcrmc-main"] });
}
```

## 5. Data Generator → DT App Integration

### Metric Dimensions
Network metrics are sent via MINT protocol with dimensions that become filterable in DQL:
```
healthcare.network.device.cpu.utilization,site="kcrmc-main",device="core-rtr-01",vendor="cisco_ios" gauge,35.2 1713456000000
```
In DQL `timeseries` queries, these dimensions are accessed directly: `filter: {site == "kcrmc-main"}`.

### Log Attributes
Log records carry attributes that become DQL fields:
- `healthcare.site` — site code for Epic and Network logs
- `healthcare.pipeline` — `"healthcare-epic"` or `"healthcare-network"`
- `network.device.site` — site code in NetFlow records
- `network.device.hostname` — device name in Network logs

### Topology as Config
The `config/hospital/topology.yaml` file defines:
- Site names, addresses, GPS coordinates
- Device inventory (hostname, vendor, model, interfaces, IP scheme)
- Changing the hub location requires updating this file AND rebuilding the network container

## 6. Deployment Workflow

### The Deploy Dance (proven reliable)

```bash
# 1. Edit code locally at /tmp/healthcare-app/
# 2. Build
cd /tmp/healthcare-app && npx dt-app build

# 3. Bump version
sed -i '' 's/"version": "X.Y.Z"/"version": "X.Y.Z+1"/' app.config.json

# 4. Deploy (local only — needs browser SSO)
npx dt-app deploy

# 5. Sync to git repo
rsync -av --exclude node_modules --exclude .dt-app --exclude dist \
  /tmp/healthcare-app/ /tmp/hcg-push/dynatrace-apps/healthcare-health-monitoring/
cd /tmp/hcg-push && git add -A && git commit -m "vX.Y.Z: description" && git push

# 6. Sync to VM
rsync -avz --exclude node_modules --exclude .dt-app --exclude dist \
  -e "ssh -i ~/.ssh/key.pem" /tmp/healthcare-app/ user@vm:~/repo/dynatrace-apps/healthcare-health-monitoring/
```

### Generator Container Rebuild (when topology/config changes)

```bash
ssh user@vm 'cd ~/repo && \
  docker build -t registry/network:vX.Y.Z -f deploy/docker/Dockerfile.network . && \
  az acr login --name registry && \
  docker push registry/network:vX.Y.Z && \
  kubectl rollout restart deployment network-generator -n healthcare-gen'
```

## 7. Shell Scripting Pitfalls

| Issue | Details | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Heredoc writes silently fail** | Shell heredocs (`cat << 'EOF' > file`) can silently corrupt files when content contains special characters, backticks, or dollar signs | Use a Python script to write files instead |
| **SSH + deploy doesn't work** | `npx dt-app deploy` via SSH gets stuck waiting for browser SSO | Deploy locally only |
| **GitHub SSH from VM** | The VM may not have GitHub SSH keys configured | Push from local machine, not from VM |

## 8. Recommended AI Skill Structure

Based on this project, an AI skill for DT app development should cover:

### Skill Files
```
dt-app-development/
  SKILL.md              # Entry point — when to use, quick reference
  references/
    strato-components.md    # Component catalog with correct import paths + props
    dql-patterns.md         # Query patterns, filter injection, timeseries vs fetch
    app-config.md           # Scopes, version management, deploy workflow
    campus-map.md           # SVG + Canvas overlay pattern, geo projection
    common-pitfalls.md      # Build failures, version conflicts, component bugs
```

### Key Rules the Skill Should Enforce
1. Always bump version before deploy
2. Import charts from `@dynatrace/strato-components/charts` (not `-preview`)
3. `HoneycombChart` takes `number[]` only
4. `gapPolicy="connect"` on all TimeseriesChart instances
5. `withSiteFilter` must handle both `timeseries ` and `timeseries\n` patterns
6. Canvas overlays on SVG must use uniform scaling to match `preserveAspectRatio`
7. Site alias maps for backward compatibility when renaming sites
8. Always ensure hub site is present in geoSites even if DQL returns no data for it
